## üóÇÔ∏è Key Implementation Details

### Next.js App Router

-   **App Directory**: Uses `src/app` for routing, layouts, and server/client components.
-   **Dynamic Routing**: Job details use `[id]/page.js` and generate static params for SSG.
-   **SEO**: Dynamic metadata, Open Graph, Twitter, and JSON-LD structured data for job postings.
-   **Global Providers**: Application state and navbar are provided in `layout.js`.

### React Patterns

-   **Context API**: Global state for job applications (`ApplicationContext.js`).
-   **Custom Hooks**: `useLocalStorage` for persistent state.
-   **Component Composition**: Reusable components (JobCard, Navbar, LoadingSpinner, Skeletons).
-   **Client/Server Components**: Job details split into server (SEO, data) and client (interactivity, icons).

### Styling

-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first, responsive, and modern design.
-   **Custom Animations**: Fade-in, slide-up, and pulse for smooth UI.
-   **Consistent Design System**: Color palette, spacing, typography, and shadows.

### Icons

-   **react-icons**: All icons are now from react icons.
-   No inline SVGs‚Äîicons are React components for consistency and maintainability.

-   **Apply to Jobs**: Click "Apply Now" on job detail pages.
-   **Track Applications**: Navbar counter updates in real-time.
-   **Loading States**: Skeletons and spinners provide feedback during data fetching.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Notes

-   **Path Aliases**: Use `@/` for imports from `src/` (see `jsconfig.json`).
-   **App Router**: All routing and layouts are in `src/app/`.
-   **SEO**: Job detail pages include dynamic metadata and structured data for better discoverability.
-   **Icons**: To use a new icon, import from `react-icons/hi` and use as a React component.
